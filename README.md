# Mariana Osorio's pre-work for CTD

This project is an API based website that showcases some data from SWAPI (the 
Star Wars API). 
The purpose of this page is to prove my ability to work with CSS-HTML and JS and be able to participate in CTD in the near future.

## Run the Page 
To run this page clone the repository and locally, open the index.html file that can be found in the star-wars-page folder. Google Chrome is the preferred browser.
From there you should be able to navigate the entirety of the page.

## Thank you!
Thank you so much for taking the time and reviewing my code. I really appreciate the opportunity and look forward to hearing from you.
Any feedback would be really appreciated.
